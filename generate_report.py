    Performance Metrics Calculation Notes:
    --------------------------------------
    To ensure consistency throughout the report, metrics are calculated as follows:
    
    1. Overall Improvement: (average_cb_reward - average_ab_reward) / average_ab_reward * 100%
       Where averages are calculated across all contexts.
       This yields the 203.07% value.
    
    2. Mean of Individual Improvements: Average of the percentage improvements calculated for each context.
       This yields the 145.99% value, which differs from the overall improvement due to the mathematics
       of averaging ratios vs. calculating a ratio of averages.
    
    3. Context-Specific Analysis: Individual context improvements range from -45.57% to 315.34%,
       showing high variability across different user types and times of day.
    
    All numerical values in text, charts, and tables should be consistent with these calculations
    and derived directly from the context_performance_best_config.csv data.

        "which is beneficial for discovering optimal recommendations across diverse user contexts but may reduce "
        "short-term performance. Lower values (e.g., 30.0) focus more on exploiting known good options, potentially "

        "* Power T: Controls the decay rate of exploration over time. Higher values (e.g., 0.9) maintain exploration "
